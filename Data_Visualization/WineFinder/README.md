# WineFinder Shiny App


## Overview
A delectable wine definitely would  dim your memorable moments, but picking a wine is a time-consuming issue. Now, instead of spending hours and hours at liquor store, you just need to click some buttons to indicate what you  want(price,country,region, winery...etc), my app would choose the  wine for you. Also for wine lovers or researchers, you can use my app to compare or investigate wines since my dataset is reliable. It is scraped from **WineEnthusiast**, one of the authoritative website of wines.
